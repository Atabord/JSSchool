# Challenge CO6
## Backend endpoints

* Generate a backend rest service with the necessary endpoints to use in the application
* Integrate MongoDB to save all reservations

    Detailed specs:
    - Create some JS code to populate MongoDB with books information.
    - Create a method to return all books. This method could receive a QUERY parameter to filter the books by bookShelf: Quito, Medellin, Digital, etcâ€¦.
    - Create a method to return the info of 1 book.
    - Create a method to lend a Book. This method should validate the book is not lent.
    - The backend should Have users.
    - Create a login endpoint for a user to authenticate and receive a token
    - All the endpoints except Login are secured. Use a JWT approach
    - Create a Detailed Readme on how to run the backend

* Create at least 3 endpoints to be consumed
* Use express architecture to mount all services
* Push all changes to your GitHub repo

### Get All the books

### Get one book
    Call `/books/[book id]` with Get method and your token in the header info.

### Lend a book
    Call `/books/[book id]/lend` with PATCH method and your token in the header info.

 * I decided to make it with PATCH method because when you have rented it, the available copies will be reduced by one
 * You can't lend a book with no available copies unless it is digital
